# Product Hunt API Rate Limit Guide

## Current Issue: Rate Limit Exceeded üö®

The bot has hit the Product Hunt API rate limit:
```
"rate_limit_reached": "Sorry. You have exceeded the API rate limit, please try again later."
"limit": 6250, "remaining": -50, "reset_in": 359
```

## What Happened

1. **Rate Limit**: 6,250 requests per time period
2. **Current Status**: -50 remaining (exceeded by 50 requests)
3. **Reset Time**: ~6 minutes (359 seconds)

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Reset (Recommended)
- **Wait 6-10 minutes** for the rate limit to reset
- The bot should work normally after the reset
- No code changes needed

### Option 2: Deploy Rate Limit Handling
I've added proper rate limit handling to the bot:

#### **Enhanced Error Detection**
- Detects rate limit errors specifically
- Stops retrying immediately when rate limit is hit
- Provides clear error messages

#### **Improved Retry Logic**
- Reduced retry attempts to avoid hitting limits
- Longer delays between retries
- Graceful handling of rate limit errors

## Rate Limit Details

### Product Hunt API Limits
- **Limit**: 6,250 requests per time period
- **Reset**: Every hour (approximately)
- **Current Usage**: Exceeded by 50 requests

### Why This Happened
The bot was trying multiple query variations with retries, which quickly consumed the rate limit:
- 3 query variations √ó multiple retries √ó rapid deployment attempts
- Each failed attempt still counts against the rate limit

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Implement Rate Limit Monitoring
```typescript
// Check rate limit headers
const rateLimitInfo = {
  remaining: headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining'),
  reset: headers.get('X-RateLimit-Reset'),
  limit: headers.get('X-RateLimit-Limit')
};
```

### 2. Adaptive Polling
- Reduce polling frequency when approaching limits
- Implement exponential backoff
- Cache responses to reduce API calls

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Stop immediately on rate limit errors
- Provide clear user feedback
- Implement graceful degradation

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Good News
- **API Authentication**: Working correctly
- **API URL**: Correct (`https://api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql`)
- **Token**: Valid (44 characters detected)
- **Query Structure**: Compatible with API

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue
- **Rate Limit**: Exceeded, need to wait for reset

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Wait 6-10 minutes)
1. **Do nothing** - let the rate limit reset
2. **Test again** after the reset period
3. **Monitor logs** for successful API calls

### After Rate Limit Reset
1. **Deploy the enhanced rate limit handling**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add rate limit handling and reduce retry attempts"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test the bot**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/bot
   ```

3. **Monitor for success**:
   ```
   [INFO] Successfully fetched top posts
   [INFO] Product Hunt API connection successful
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Success Case
```
[INFO] Initializing Product Hunt API client
[INFO] Trying Product Hunt API query variation 1
[INFO] Successfully fetched top posts
[INFO] Product Hunt API connection successful
```

### Rate Limit Case
```
[WARN] Product Hunt API rate limit reached, will retry later
[ERROR] Product Hunt API rate limit exceeded. Please wait 6-10 minutes before trying again.
```

## Long-term Improvements

1. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Track usage and adjust polling
2. **Caching**: Cache responses to reduce API calls
3. **Adaptive Scheduling**: Adjust polling frequency based on limits
4. **Fallback Data**: Use cached data when rate limited

The bot should work perfectly once the rate limit resets! üöÄ
